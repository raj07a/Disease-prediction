# 🤖 AI-Powered Intelligent Disease Prediction System

## 📚 Introduction
Early detection of diseases can drastically improve patient outcomes. However, symptom overlap often leads to misdiagnosis. This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to build an intelligent disease prediction system that predicts possible diseases based on user-input symptoms.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Traditional diagnosis methods are time-consuming and prone to human error. There is a pressing need for an AI-powered tool that can assist users in early-stage disease prediction.

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict top possible diseases based on symptoms.
- Recommend precautions to users.
- Enhance diagnosis speed and accuracy using Machine Learning.
